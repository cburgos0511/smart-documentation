# Frequently Asked Questions

> **Common questions about Smart Documentation Agent**

## General Questions

### What is Smart Documentation Agent?

Smart Documentation Agent is a conversational AI system that uses Claude (via Cursor IDE) combined with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to automatically analyze codebases and generate comprehensive documentation. It's not a standalone application - it's an intelligent agent that you have conversations with to maintain perfect documentation.

### How is this different from other documentation tools?

Traditional documentation tools require manual maintenance and often become outdated. Smart Documentation Agent uses AI to automatically analyze your code, understand patterns, and generate documentation that's always current and accurate. It also provides direct integration with Confluence and Jira through MCP tools.

### Do I need to write any code?

No! Smart Documentation Agent is completely conversational. You just talk to Claude, and it does all the work. No TypeScript, no servers, no complex setup - just intelligent conversations.

### What programming languages does it support?

Smart Documentation Agent can analyze codebases in any programming language, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and more. It understands the structure and patterns regardless of the language.

## Technical Questions

### What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a revolutionary technology that allows AI agents to directly interact with external systems and APIs. It gives Claude "hands" to manipulate your tools directly, rather than just talking about them.

### How does the Confluence integration work?

The system uses MCP Atlassian tools to directly access your Confluence workspace. Claude can read existing pages, create new pages, update content, and maintain bidirectional references between local files and Confluence pages.

### Is my code secure?

Yes! The system processes your code locally and only sends necessary information to Claude for analysis. No sensitive code is stored externally, and all communication is encrypted.

### What if I don't have Confluence?

Smart Documentation Agent works with any documentation system that has an API. While Confluence is the most common integration, you can also use it with other systems like Notion, GitBook, or even just local files.

## Setup and Configuration

### How long does setup take?

Basic setup takes about 10 minutes. You need to install Cursor IDE, enable Claude integration, configure MCP tools, and create an agent configuration file.

### What are the system requirements?

- Cursor IDE with Claude integration
- Atlassian account with Confluence access
- Stable internet connection
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended

### Do I need special permissions?

You need standard Confluence and Jira permissions. The system only requires read/write access to documentation spaces and the ability to create issues.

### Can I use this with my existing workflow?

Yes! Smart Documentation Agent integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows. It doesn't replace your current tools - it enhances them with AI-powered automation.

## Usage and Workflow

### How do I get started?

1. Install Cursor IDE with Claude integration
2. Configure MCP Atlassian tools
3. Create your agent configuration
4. Ask Claude to analyze your codebase and create documentation

### What kind of documentation does it create?

The system generates PSM (Product Support Management) format documentation with sections for support teams, key concepts, FAQs, and technical implementation details.

### How often should I update documentation?

Documentation updates automatically when you ask Claude to analyze your code. You can update it as often as needed, and the system ensures everything stays current.

### Can multiple team members use this?

Yes! The system supports collaborative documentation. Multiple team members can use it simultaneously, and all changes are synchronized automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude isn't responding to my requests

- Check that Cursor IDE is properly configured
- Verify your Claude API key is valid
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try restarting Cursor IDE

### MCP tools aren't working

- Verify MCP tools are properly installed
- Check your Atlassian credentials
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions
- Test the connection with a simple query

### Documentation isn't updating in Confluence

- Check your Confluence permissions
- Verify the space and page exist
- Ensure the MCP tools are properly configured
- Try updating a simple page first

### The agent isn't following my configuration

- Check your agent configuration file
- Verify the file is in the correct location
- Ensure the configuration syntax is correct
- Restart Cursor IDE after making changes

## Business and ROI

### What's the ROI for my team?

For a 100-developer team, the system typically generates $1.4M+ in annual savings through 95% reduction in documentation maintenance, 80% faster onboarding, and 40% increased development velocity.

### How long does it take to see results?

Most teams see immediate improvements in documentation quality and consistency. Full ROI is typically realized within 3-6 months of implementation.

### What if my team is resistant to change?

The system is designed to be non-disruptive. It integrates with existing workflows and provides immediate value. Start with a pilot program to demonstrate benefits before full rollout.

### Is this suitable for small teams?

Yes! The system scales from small teams (5+ developers) to large enterprises (500+ developers). The ROI is significant at any scale.

## Advanced Features

### Can I customize the documentation format?

Yes! The system uses configurable templates that can be customized for your team's specific needs and preferences.

### Does it work with version control?

Yes! The system integrates with Git and other version control systems to track changes and maintain documentation history.

### Can I use this for API documentation?

Absolutely! The system excels at analyzing API endpoints and generating comprehensive API documentation with examples and schemas.

### Does it support multiple projects?

Yes! The system can handle multiple projects simultaneously and maintain separate documentation for each.

## Security and Compliance

### Is this compliant with enterprise security standards?

Yes! The system uses enterprise-grade security with OAuth 2.0 authentication, encrypted communication, and audit logging.

### Can I use this in regulated industries?

The system is designed to meet enterprise compliance requirements and can be configured for specific regulatory needs.

### What about data privacy?

The system processes data locally and only sends necessary information to Claude for analysis. No sensitive data is stored externally.

### Can I audit what the system does?

Yes! The system provides complete audit logging of all operations and changes.
